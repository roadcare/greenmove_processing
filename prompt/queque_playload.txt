actually, From mobile side app of greenmove, user send the trip and trip detail in format of a playload ( json), then the backend receive playload, process it and insert into backend database. Now we have much more user, and it may happen that there may be 3000 user send playload at a sametime to backend, each playload may having size about 5 Mb. Do you have any solution to do it, i think a bout using Azure Storage account , with an Queque, Blobstorage and something to process the queque and insert data to database. Can you detail me the solution
